Hi

If you browse the internet, you probably have 100s if not 1000s of bookmarks saved in your browser. Problem is, your bookmarks are so many (and cluttered) that you don't even refer to your bookmarks list anymore.

Ironic. Isn't it? Yeah, ikr.

I faced the same problem. I have 1000s of bookmarks in my browsers which aren't easy to access. I don't even refer to that list any longer.

So I wanted a simple tool (with robust search) to help me manage and organize my bookmarks into nested folders and tags (for easy access)... and share them with my friends easily, whenever I want to. You know how cumbersome it is to share links via email.

I also wanted this tool to be elegant (cause why not). I love beautiful user interfaces.

That's why I started this side project...

- to create a tool to help me manage my bookmarks
- to teach myself coding
- to practice the habit of consistency

Thanks for reading. If you want to give this tool a test, see you when it's live!
